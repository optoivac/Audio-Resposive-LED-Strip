# Audio Visualizer LED Strip

This project is an audio visualizer that streams data from a computer to an Arduino, which controls an LED strip. The LED strip changes colors based on the audio output from your computer. It is still a work in progress. Love Late night Ideas

Wil most likely change to a esp bluethoth paired device over usb serial communication
